-   Implement permissions (for command executions)
-   Implement automatic flagging system message handling
-   Connect to database (start off with sqlite and create wrapper for easy switching to another engine later)
-   Add database integration and loading to local
-   Change `auth_info_baileys` folder name and use from env
