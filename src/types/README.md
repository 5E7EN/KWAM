# Types

This directory contains all the types used in the project. Each type and its related types are defined in a separate file and exported from the `index.ts` file (for uncluttered access in `import` statements).

## TODO

-   Move the types currently being stored at the root of the folder to their respective subdirectories. Gotta figure out a name for those subdirs.
