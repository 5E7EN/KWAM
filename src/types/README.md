# Types

This directory contains all the types used in the project. Each type and its related types are defined in a separate file and exported from the `index.ts` file (for clean paths in `import` statements).

## TODO

-   Move the types currently being stored at the root of this folder to their respective subdirectories. Gotta figure out a name for those subdirs. :D
